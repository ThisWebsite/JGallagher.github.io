</h3>

<br>
My three words to describe myself: Not very dumb
<br>
My favorite subject in school is math becuase I like to problem solve and think

<b>I don't currently have any hobbies but I might have some someday</b>

<h3>Goals</h3>

<p> I have many goals that I want to achieve. I want to get good grades. I can do this by focusing in school. I also want to get to know as many people as I possibly can. I don't have any emotional goals because I don't understand what one might be.
